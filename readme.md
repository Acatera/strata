## Language Feature List

- **Control Constructs**: Introduces fundamental control constructs (`if`, `while`, `for`) to structure code flow.
- **Direct Memory Access**: Simplified mechanisms for direct memory manipulation without the verbosity of assembly.
- **Subroutine Handling**: Enhanced handling of subroutines or functions with support for local variables and arguments.
- **Basic Types and Operations**: Support for basic data types and operations that abstract away some low-level bitwise operations.
- **Memory Safety**: Features that aid in preventing common memory errors without the overhead of full memory management.
- **Inline Optimization Hints**: Allows hints or directives for optimizations that can be used by the compiler for generating efficient code.
- **Macro System**: A powerful macro system to define complex operations with simpler syntax.
- **Assembler Integration**: Ability to integrate raw assembler instructions within the code for critical performance sections.
- **Modular Code Organization**: Support for separate compilation units or modules to aid in code organization.
- **Simplified Syntax**: A more readable and writable syntax than assembly, targeting clarity and brevity.
- **Minimal Runtime**: Keeping the runtime minimal to stay close to the hardware and maintain performance.
- **Cross-Platform Assembly Generation**: Capable of generating assembly code for different architectures from the same source code.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling constructs to manage runtime errors in a controlled way.
- **Debugging Support**: Integration with debugging tools for stepping through code and inspecting state.
- **Documentation Integration**: Support for embedding documentation directly into source code for maintainability.
- **Assembler-Level Profiling**: Profiling support that relates high-level code to low-level assembler performance metrics.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to be easily extensible with new features and optimizations.
- **Community-Centric Tooling**: Tools and ecosystem developed with community contributions and needs in mind.
